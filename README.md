### Objective
The primary objective of a Bluetooth-controlled Home Automation System is to enable remote control and management of various electrical devices within a home using Bluetooth technology. This provides greater convenience, efficiency, and comfort for users by automating routine tasks and allowing them to control home devices with a simple interface on a mobile phone or tablet.
The system allows users to control appliances such as lights, fans, air conditioners, and other electrical devices remotely using Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices (smartphones or tablets).
Home automation helps in controlling devices in a more efficient manner. For instance, turning off lights and fans when not in use or automating schedules can save energy, reduce power consumption, and lower electricity bills.

### Key Activities
**Hardware Setup and Device Selection**: Devices to Control: Identify which home appliances or devices you want to automate (e.g., lights, fans, air conditioners, security devices).
**Wiring and Circuit Design**: onnect the Bluetooth module (HC-05) to the microcontroller for Bluetooth communication. Wire relay modules to control devices like lights, fans, or other appliances (ensuring safety when dealing with high-voltage devices).
**Bluetooth Communication Setup**: Set up Bluetooth communication between the microcontroller and a smartphone or tablet using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
**Software Development**: Write the firmware for the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino code) that listens for Bluetooth signals and controls the relay outputs based on those signals.

### Technologies Used
**Bluetooth Communication Technology**: Bluetooth allows wireless communication between the mobile device (smartphone or tablet) and the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP32). Bluetooth modules like HC-05 or HC-06 are typically used to establish this communication for short-range control (usually up to 10 meters).
**Microcontroller (MCU)**: The microcontroller serves as the central processing unit that receives Bluetooth commands and controls the connected devices (e.g., lights, fans, or other appliances).
**Relay Modules**:  Relays act as switches to control high-voltage home appliances (like lights, fans, etc.) by opening or closing electrical circuits. The microcontroller controls the relays based on the Bluetooth commands received.
**Software Development**: bedded programming is used to write the logic for the microcontroller. The software reads Bluetooth commands, processes them, and controls the relays accordingly
**Mobile App Development**:  A mobile application is created to allow users to send Bluetooth commands to the microcontroller. It typically includes buttons or controls for turning devices on or off, and it communicates with the Bluetooth module to transmit commands.
